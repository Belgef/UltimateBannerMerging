[h1][b]Ultimate Banner Merging[/b] is a mod that adds an enemy banner and trophy merging system and new effects.[/h1]

Stack all of your dusty banners and trophies into one
The more mobs and bosses you kill - the more powerful you will get. Isn't that right?

[olist]
[*]Every banner or trophy in your inventory increases your attack, defense, and loot against the corresponding enemy or boss. Also, this effect is growing with a larger quantity.
[*]You can merge every enemy banner and trophy more and more until you'll 
have [b]The Banner[/b] and [b]The Trophy[/b] that give you maximum effects.
[*]Each crafted banner and trophy has a multiplier, which means how effective it is with respect to its ingredients.
[*]Banners and trophies have the same effect when stored in piggy bank, safe, defenders forge, or void vault/bag.
