[c/ffe600:Ultimate Banner Merging] is a mod that adds an enemy banner merging system and new banner effects.

1. Every banner in your inventory increases your attack and defense against the corresponding enemy. Also, this effect is growing with a more significant quantity.
2. You can merge every enemy banner into bigger and bigger banners until you'll have one super banner that uses every enemy banner.
3. Each banner has a multiplier, which means how effective it is with respect to its ingredients.
